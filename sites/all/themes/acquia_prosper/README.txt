-- SUMMARY --

Acquia Prosper is an advanced Drupal theme, with a monochromatic look and clean lines.
This theme is a subtheme of the Fusion Core base theme.  Acquia Prosper + Fusion is a little different from most Drupal themes you may be used to.  Positioning and block styles are controlled through Drupal's UI via the Skinr module, which is required if you want to actually use styles.  These configurable options give Acquia Prosper an unparalleled amount of flexibility and features.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

Fusion Core:
  http://drupal.org/project/fusion

Skinr:
  http://drupal.org/project/skinr


-- INSTALLATION --

* Download both Acquia Prosper and Fusion (http://drupal.org/project/fusion)

* Unpack them as usual within your themes folder.  You'll see two themes in the Fusion folder -- Fusion Core (the base theme), and Fusion Starter (a commented starter theme for creating your own subthemes)

* Enable Fusion Core and Acquia Prosper on your themes page on example.com/admin/build/themes

* Set Acquia Prosper as your default theme

* Download and enable the Skinr module (NOTE: Skinr is still under heavy development. The skins for Acquia Prosper are not included in the 7x-dev version)



* You may need to give your administrator role Skinr permissions on example.com/admin/user/permissions


-- CONFIGURATION --

* You can control many settings on Acquia Prosper's theme settings page: example.com/admin/build/themes/settings/acquia_prosper
   - Settings include menus, fixed vs fluid page width, sidebar widths, typography, search results, and administrator/developer helper features

* Go to your Blocks page at example.com/admin/build/block and place blocks into regions as desired, save your settings

* When hovering your cursor over blocks, a gear icon will appear -- you can use this to get to the block configuration page for that specific block


  NOTE: Currently Skinr's user interface is in a beta state, and only supports checkboxes at this time. Improvements are coming soon, but in the meantime, you will need to exercise some self control and not enable multiple conflicting styles at the same time. For example, only enable a single width option and a single alignment option at once. Many of the styles may also not layer well.

* Use these width and positioning options for blocks to configure your layout

* Use the style options to set up different visual styles for different blocks


--NOTE--

Skinr is not used with this 7x dev version.

Ubercart is not used with this 7x dev version.
